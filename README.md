Wind Energy is one of the well-known renewable sources of energy (I know you all are aware). Rotation of turbines at
generating stations produces electricity, which is supplied to homes, offices and buildings for
consumption. Traditionally, power grids are unidirectional, supply from stations to homes.
Wind energy, however, can be produced locally too and thus we need bidirectional lines in
the grid so that excess energy can be supplied from local turbines to power deficient locations. This allows for more efficient use of electricity.

In this project, I have made use of Tarjan's Algorithm for efficient real world implementation of Wind power grid connecting different cities.
The cities are repesented by the vertices of the graph, whlie the edges represent the power lines.
